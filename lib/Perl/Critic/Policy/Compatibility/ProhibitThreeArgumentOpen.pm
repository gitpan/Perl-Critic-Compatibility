=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::ProhibitThreeArgumentOpen - Don't allow three-argument open unless the code uses a version of perl that supports it.


=head1 AFFILIATION

This policy is part of L<Perl::Critic::Compatibility>.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes
Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::ProhibitThreeArgumentOpen version
1.000.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Don't allow three-argument C<open> unless the module declares a
dependency upon perl 5.6 or higher.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perls prior to 5.6 don't support the three-argument form of C<open>.
If you want your code to remain compatible with those versions of
perl, you can't use it.

If your code explicitly declares a requirement on a version of perl
greater than or equal to 5.6, then three-argument C<open> is fine.

    open FILE, '<', 'blah';             # not ok

    use 5.006;
    open FILE, '<', 'blah';             # ok

    require 5.8.8;
    open FILE, '<', 'blah';             # ok


=head1 INTERFACE

Standard for a L<Perl::Critic::Policy>.


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

None.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

This policy has no configuration options beyond the standard ones.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<Perl::Critic>


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

This policy directly contradicts
L<Perl::Critic::Policy::InputOutput::ProhibitTwoArgOpen>.  If you don't
declare perl version requirements, then you cannot have both of these
policies enabled at the same time (unless you like getting
violations).


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-perl-critic-compatible@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web
interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org>.


=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Adam Kennedy for inspiring this.  Nay, demanding it.
